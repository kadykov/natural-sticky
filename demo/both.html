        <h2>Both Header and Footer Animation</h2>
        <p>
          This demo shows both the header and footer with natural sticky
          behavior simultaneously. While this can be useful in some cases, we
          generally recommend using them separately to avoid overwhelming the
          user.
        </p>

        <h3>ðŸŽ¯ Less Distracting by Design</h3>
        <p>
          Even with both elements animated, notice how the movement feels
          natural and non-intrusive. Traditional slide animations would be
          overwhelming with two animated elements, but our natural approach
          keeps things smooth and unobtrusive.
        </p>

        <h3>When to Use Both Together</h3>
        <p>Having both animated can work well for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Apps with distinct top navigation and bottom action bars</li>
          <li>Media players with top controls and bottom playback controls</li>
          <li>Games or interactive content with UI elements at both ends</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          However, for content-focused sites, using just one usually provides a
          cleaner experience.
        </p>

        <h3>Complete Implementation Example</h3>
        <div
          style="
            background: #f8f9fa;
            padding: 1rem;
            border-radius: 4px;
            border-left: 4px solid #007bff;
            margin: 1rem 0;
            overflow-x: auto;
          "
        >
          <pre><code>document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const header = document.querySelector('.sticky-header');
  const footer = document.querySelector('.sticky-footer');

  if (header && window.naturalStickyTop) {
    window.naturalStickyTop(header);
  }

  if (footer && window.naturalStickyBottom) {
    window.naturalStickyBottom(footer);
  }
});</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>
          <strong>Ultra lightweight:</strong> Combined, both scripts are only
          <strong>2.4KB minified</strong> with
          <strong>zero dependencies</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Both elements work independently - the header logic doesn't interfere
          with the footer logic and vice versa. Each maintains its own scroll
          state and positioning calculations.
        </p>

        <h3>The Natural Approach</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of using CSS transitions or JavaScript animations, we let the
          browser's native scrolling do all the work. When you scroll down,
          elements naturally flow with the content. When you scroll up, we
          position them just outside the viewport so they naturally scroll back
          into view.
        </p>

        <p>
          Try scrolling in different patterns - fast, slow, short scrolls, long
          scrolls - to see how both elements respond naturally to your input.
        </p>

        <p>
          Notice how there's no jarring slide-in effect, no fixed animation
          timing that doesn't match your scroll speed, and no layout shifts. The
          movement feels completely organic.
        </p>
